# CMS---CRUD
Creating a basic headless CMS with CRUD functionality using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend.
Backend (Node.js with Express.js)
Setup Project Structure:
Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a Node.js project with npm init.
Install Dependencies:
Install Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
Install a database driver like mysql or pg for PostgreSQL.
Database Connection:
Set up a connection to your chosen database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
Create a database and tables for storing entities and their attributes dynamically.
API Routes:
Create routes for handling CRUD operations on entities.
Routes should handle creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of entities and their attributes.
Business Logic:
Implement logic for dynamically creating tables based on the entity's attributes.
Ensure proper validation of data before performing CRUD operations.
Middleware:
Use middleware for error handling, logging, and any other necessary tasks.
Frontend (React.js)
Setup Project Structure:
Create a new React.js project using create-react-app or a similar tool.
Set up necessary folder structure for components, pages, and styles.
Install Dependencies:
Install any additional dependencies like Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.
Create Entity Forms:
Create forms for users to define entities and their attributes.
Allow users to specify attribute names and types.
Display Entities and Attributes:
Fetch and display existing entities and their attributes from the backend.
Allow users to view, update, and delete entities.
Integration with Backend:
Make API calls to the backend to perform CRUD operations on entities.
Handle responses and update UI accordingly.
Styling:
Apply CSS or use a UI library like Bootstrap to style your frontend components.
